Project Idea:
The main purpose is to develop an electronic certificate with the new approach of authenticating the certificate ie. scan the QR code.
Also is to enhance the credibility of paper based certificates, also electronically reduce the loss risks of manual distribution of certificates. 
The system that reduces the likelihood of the forgery.
To keep the sensitive data of students secured and immutable using blockchain.

The system has four stakeholders:
1.  Certificate Issuers/ Committee Head:
 	The role of Certificate Issuer is to select the required template of certificate and add the details of every student individually or by bulk upload.

2. Two Higher Authorities
	The Higher Authorities need to verify the pending certificates that have been issued by the Committee Head

3. Students
	 The students receive the link of the certificate and then can download the soft copy of the certificate and can use this link or the ecopy for sharing the certificates to further companies or Universities.
 
4. Administration
	The administrator could add, manage, delete all the Certificate Issuers, Higher Authorities etc.

Verification by Companies or Organisations:

When a company acquires an e-certificate link or soft copy of the certificate from a job applicant, they can verify the veracity of the associated certificate either by scanning the QR code or by using the link provided by the job applicant. The message “Valid Certificate” is displayed only when the information from applicants matches the information in the system.
